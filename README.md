# Scenario
My client is Willem to help with his squash game, because this is what my program is mainly for. I talked about how my client doesn't know what food is best for their squash game and what would give them the most energy. My client wants their food plan all mapped out. My advisor is Daniel Paccione. My product is a squash food planner that adjusts itself based on what the client needs. It is appropriate to the problem because the problem is the person isn't getting the necessary energy required for squash from his diet.


# Rationale
The software I will be building is a food planner for the squash team. I am either gonna build it in javascript or python, I havent decided which one is better for my project yet. I will most likly use the p5.js library if I am to use javascript in my code. I think this would be a good program for the Squash player cause many of the students dont know what would be best for them to eat. 

# Success Criteria
My product is going to help the sqush team perform and be more active on the court

# Interview
How many games of squash do you play during the seasons?
	On average I play around 10 squash games per season. But that doesn't include the numerous practices and other training that comes with being on the team. 
What type of  food do you eat before squash games?
	Before squash games I either have a bag of chips or maybe an arizona. If not, I will usually eat what was offered for lunch at the school. 
Do you feel you donâ€™t get the proper nutrients to fuel your squash games?
	Not always, sometimes the school provides healthy meals. I do feel like I could eat healthier so in turn my squash game would be better. Sometimes I get tired easily or I don't feel 100% in the game. 
Would it be helpful if your meals were planned out before your games and practices?
Yes it would be extremely helpful. If I had a program that would tell me what to eat and when to eat before my next squash game.
