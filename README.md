# Interview
How many games of squash do you play during the seasons?
	On average I play around 10 squash games per season. But that doesn't include the numerous practices and other training that comes with being on the team. 
What type of  food do you eat before squash games?
	Before squash games I either have a bag of chips or maybe an arizona. If not, I will usually eat what was offered for lunch at the school. 
Do you feel you donâ€™t get the proper nutrients to fuel your squash games?
	Not always, sometimes the school provides healthy meals. I do feel like I could eat healthier so in turn my squash game would be better. Sometimes I get tired easily or I don't feel 100% in the game. 
Would it be helpful if your meals were planned out before your games and practices?
Yes it would be extremely helpful. If I had a program that would tell me what to eat and when to eat before my next squash game.
