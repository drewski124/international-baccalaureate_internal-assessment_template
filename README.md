# Scenario
My client is Willem to help with his squash game, because this is what my program is mainly for. I talked about how my client doesn't know what food is best for their squash game and what would give them the most energy. My client wants their food plan all mapped out. My advisor is Daniel Paccione. My product is a squash food planner that adjusts itself based on what the client needs. It is appropriate to the problem because the problem is the person isn't getting the necessary energy required for squash from his diet.


# Rationale
The software I will be building is a food planner for the squash team. I am going to build it by using Javascript. I will likely use the p5.js library for my javascript code. I think this would be a good program for the Squash player cause many of my teammates don't know what would be best for them to eat before each Squash practice and game.

# Success Criteria
My product is going to help Willem perform better and be more active on the court. This will be acheived by using the program to help improve their diet and consequently give him more energy. 

# Interview
How many games of squash do you play during the seasons?
	On average I play around 10 squash games per season. But that doesn't include the numerous practices and other training that comes with being on the team. 
What type of  food do you eat before squash games?
	Before squash games I either have a bag of chips or maybe an arizona. If not, I will usually eat what was offered for lunch at the school. 
Do you feel you donâ€™t get the proper nutrients to fuel your squash games?
	Not always, sometimes the school provides healthy meals. I do feel like I could eat healthier so in turn my squash game would be better. Sometimes I get tired easily or I don't feel 100% in the game. 
Would it be helpful if your meals were planned out before your games and practices?
Yes it would be extremely helpful. If I had a program that would tell me what to eat and when to eat before my next squash game.
